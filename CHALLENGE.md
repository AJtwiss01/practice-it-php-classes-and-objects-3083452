# Objective

1. Use a constructor method to improve object initialization

## Program Logic

* When a workspace is created, it's URL and admin should be set automatically
* When a message is created, it's date should be set automatically
* Only properties needed to create an object should be promoted by the constructor

## Requirements

* Add a constructor method to each class
* Refactor each instance of an object's instantiation to use the constructor
* Use the constructor to carry out any behaviors that should happen when an object is first created
* Run the main app file to verify the program still works
