# Objective

1. Intialize an object's properties
2. Add implementation for an object's methods

## Program Logic

* Members can only be added to a workspace through an admin and not through the workspace directly
* The member that creates a workspace should be assigned as the workspace admin
* A member can only create chatâ€™s for a workspace it belongs to
* Assess where a properties accessibility or initial value needs to be updated

## Requirements

* Create two member objects: one admin and one non-admin
* Use the admin member to create a workspace and add the non-admin as a member
* Use any member to create a chat in the workspace and post a message
* Print the workspace url, members, and chat messages to the terminal to verify the program works.
